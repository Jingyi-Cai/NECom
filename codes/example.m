Data struct of the model:
(Assume the community model has I metabolites and J reactions, belonging to
N species. )

       rxns:       J by 1 string cell reactions
       mets:       I by 1 string cell metabolites
       S:          I by J Stoichiometry matrix of the model
       c:          J by 1 objective 0-1 vector 
       lb:         J by 1 real number vector for lower bounds of reactions 
       ub:         J by 1 real number vector for upper bounds of reactions 
       rxnSps:     J by 1 vector indicating to which species a reaction belong
                    (modelCom.rxns{j} belongs to species #modelCom.rxnSps(j))
       metSps:     I by 1 vector indicating to which species a metabolite belong
                    (modelCom.mets{j} belongs to species #modelCom.rxnSps(j),
                    0 for community metabolites)
       spBm:       1 by N vector indicating the ID of biomass reaction for each species
                    (species k has biomass reaction modelCom.rxns{modelCom.spBm(k)})
       EXsp:       Ids for exchange reactions between species and
                   community [a_ij] is the id for the export of i-th

% the metabolites may only be exchanged between sp1 and sp2 are A and B(other metabolite 
% such as proton can be exchanged between organisms and environment, so not considered here)
% let's label A and B a metabolite number 1,2 repectively
% the associated crossfeeding reactions are EX_A_2_sp1 EX_B_2_sp1 EX_A_2_sp2 EX_B_2_sp2
% they are given an order 
parameters.cf_order=[1;2;3;4];
% find their reaction indices in the community model:
parameters.sub_indExSpi=[41;42;48;49];
% amount of crossfeeding reactions:
parameters.numSub_ExRxn=length(parameters.sub_indExSpi);
% since they are crossfeeding reactions for A,B,A,B, so their metabolite number are:  
parameters.spsInds=[1 2 1 2];
% and they belong to sp1,sp1,sp2, sp2, respectively:
parameters.sub_exSpi=[1;1;2;2];
% 
% crossfeeding reactions that can affect the availability of substrate
% uptaken by other species: EX_A_2_sp2 EX_B_2_sp2 EX_A_2_sp1 EX_B_2_sp1 and
% their indices:
parameters.other_Ex_all=[48;49;41;42];
% they belong to sp2,sp2,sp1,sp1 respectively:
parameters.other_sp_ind=[2;2;1;1];
% mapping to the reaction they may affect(refering to cf_order):

%  joint-FBA only supports abundance ratio of 1:1, in order to compare 
%  different methods in paralell we set Relative abundance for sp1 and sp2:
X=[0.5,0.5]; % they are 1:1
% run OptCom simulation
