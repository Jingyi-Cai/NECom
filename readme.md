1,make sure you have a solver that can solve mixed interger nonlinear programing has been installed, NECom currently 'baron','bonmin' and 'gurobi' solvers, bonmin solver requires installation of OPTI toolbox on Windows 
2,add all folders and their subfolders to matlab path.
3,run example.m in 'example_snowdrift' folder after setting your prefered solver in the begining of that script, which is demonstrative example for NECom simulations.
4,run 'runExozyme.m' in ./example_snowdrift/invertaseGame folder to reproduce the results for case 4 (the snowdrift game)
5,all data related to the algae and yeast case study can be found in 'DataFile_yeast_algae.xls'
